# Test assignment #1 (React, SASS)

Tasks included 
1. Get an array of list elements from a server
2. Show them on the screen
3. Reproduce the layout with certain requirements in part of scrolling behaviour
4. Add a field for adding a "tag" property to an element in the list
5. Introduce two filter fields to give a user ability to filter the list by the "name" and by newly created "tag" independently (OR condition - independent filtering by any of two input values). Initially it was AND condition, but OR looked more complex so I decided to go with OR to try to implement it.
